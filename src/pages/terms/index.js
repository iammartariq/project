          <p className={text3Class}>
            Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no
            judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration

            damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to
            an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of this
            Agreement as a court would.

          <p className={text3Class}>
            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency,
            will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of
            or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
            formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this
            Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement

            The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
            Association (the “AAA”) in Palm Beach County, Florida, under the
            AAA’s rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary
            Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as
            modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are
            available at{" "}

            You and we will select the arbitrator, and if you and we are unable
            to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within 30 days
            after the notice of arbitration is served, then the AAA will select
            the arbitrator. Arbitration will not commence until the party
            requesting arbitration has deposited U.S. $1,000 with the arbitrator
            for the arbitrator’s fees and costs. The party requesting
            arbitration will advance such sums as are required from time to time
            by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator’s fees and costs until the
            prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing
            to an alternate allocation of fees and costs.
          </p>
          <p className={text3Class}>
            The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance
            with the laws of the State of Florida, including recognized
            principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege
            recognized by law. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in
            prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by
            rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent
            required by applicable law. Judgment upon any award rendered by the
            arbitrator is final, binding and conclusive upon you and us and your
            and our respective administrators, executors, legal representatives,
            successors and assigns, and may only be entered in the state or
            federal courts of record for Palm Beach County, Florida.
