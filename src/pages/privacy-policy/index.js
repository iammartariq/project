            When you use our Services, we and service providers acting on our
            behalf may use technology to collect information about you,
            including your location, IP address, browser type, ISP, cookie

            referral and exit pages, clickstream data, pages visited, time of
            visits and information related to your device, such as hardware
            models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request
            type, the content of your request and basic usage information about
            your use of our Services, such as date and time. We may also collect
            and store information locally on your device using mechanisms, such
            as browser web storage and application data caches.
          </p>
          <p className={text3Class}>
            We and service providers acting on our be half may collect such
            information through a variety of technical methods, including
            sending cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and other anonymous
            identifiers to your device. "Cookies" are pieces of data stored on
            our computer, mobile phone or other device. A "web beacon" is a type
            of technology that lets us know if you visited a certain page or
            whether you opened an email. A "pixel tag" is a type of technology
            placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking
            activity, which is often used in combination with cookies. Other
            "identifiers" are random strings of characters used for the same
            purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie
            technology is not available. These technologies help us provide you
            with features based on your preferences, understand when you are
            interacting with our Services, and compile other information
            regarding your use of our Services.
          </p>
          <p className={text3Class}>
            Please note that, in most cases, you can stop making your location
            available to us or remove or block cookies (such as by using the
            settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to
            use our Services.
          </p>
          <p className={text3Class}>
            Further, our Services do not have the capability to respond to "Do
            Not Track" signals received from our web browsers. Do Not Track
            ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
            browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform services and websites
            that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits
            collected and across online services or websites.

            <strong>5- Network Advertising</strong>
          </p>
          <p className={text3Class}>
            From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising
            networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising
            agencies, technology vendors, and research firms. We may use these
            third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising, and
            promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you.
            Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view
            advertisements to make inferences about a consumer's interests and
            preferences, which enables such networks to deliver advertisements
            directly targeted to the consumer's specific interests. This
            practice is often referred to as "online behavioral advertising."
            For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the
            type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating
            system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or
            not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your
            Internet service provider's presence, the date and time of a visit
            to a website and other interactions between you and a website.
            Please see the Online Behavioral Advertising subsection of the
            Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information section below
            to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising
            networks from collecting information about you.

            <strong>6- Third-Party Content</strong>
          </p>
          <p className={text3Class}>
            Some content or applications, including advertisements, on our
            Services may be served by third parties, including advertisers, ad
            networks and servers, content providers and application providers.
            These third parties may collect information about you when you use
            our Services. We do not control these third parties' tracking
            technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions
            about any targeted content, you should contact the responsible
            provider directly.

              friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use
              our Services. Email addresses that you may provide for a friend or
              colleague may be used to send your friend or colleague the link or
              content you request, but will not be collected or otherwise used
              by us or any other third parties for any other purpose.
